# NetworkMapSite
This is a network map project, mostly to pratice React and front-end.


# What there is left to do
- Link with a db for username (i guess django)
- Add more project
- Finish detail view
- Detail view : close when clicking in emptiness around
- Fix bugs (terminal when opening)
- Show error message wrong login (login page)
- If not connected and try to connect to home, return to login page

# Nice to have
- Add a close icon for detail view
